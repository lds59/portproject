        Next I started sketching out possible user flows to accomplish the goals that came out of the user stories. I observed the ways Goodreads and LibraryThing designed their flows and created a visual user flow that seemed the most straightforward.

        Coming up with a concept for Lunar New Year, that not only fit our underwater theme, but also fit in with the brand was a iterative process. There were multiple themes and concepts needed to be covered in this quest. First, was brainstorming with the art team to plan out the progression of the torii gate as the player greated each Zodiac animal.

      <section>
        <p>
          Then, once the torii gate was sketched out, it was time to concept out the new koifish character for this quest. There were multiple color variations that were concepted with this character.

        Once the final brand art concepts were polished and put together, it was now time to add a more realistic feel to the quest and build a high fidlity mockup into the game.

        <p>
          My research goal was to understand the user's reading habits, such as how they discover and track books they like. Additionally, I wanted to figure out which features users deemed the most important when creating this mobile application. Once I sent this out to friends and family and received feedback, I noticed a few things:
        </p>
        <ul id="research-bullets">
          <li>
            First, four participants responded that they actually held onto the books that they finished reading - an option that was not on the survey itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            Second, when it came to features that could be incorporated into the app, many users were against the idea of adding forums to discuss books with friends. Quite a few were against virtual book clubs as well.
          </li> </br>
          <p>With this information in mind, I started thinking of a way to create a platform that could provide not only user friendliness or simplicity, but also a place to stay connected with other book lovers and sell preloved books to other users.
          </p>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="conclusion-box">
        <div class="subtitle-container">
          <h4 class="subtitle"> Conclusion </h4>
          <div class="border-line"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          In conclusion, I learned quite a bit from this project. If I were to start again from the beginning, I would add a few more questions on my user survey about the sustainability aspect of my app. For example, I would ask what users thought about having the option of providing their own shipping boxes when selling a book, if collaborating with an eco-friendly shipping company would be a good fit, if providing post-consumer packaging would be beneficial, or if all three of these options together would be most desirable. I would also do more research on different eco-friendly shipping companies and shipping costs.
