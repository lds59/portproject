        Once I incorporated the feedback from my first usability test into my first round of high fidelity mockups, I started to piece together my mobile app to look a bit more realistic.
      </p>

      <section class="execution">
        <img src="images/hifi3.jpg" alt="hifidelity3">
        <p>
          With my high fidelity mockups, I moved the modal to the bottom of the screen so it was a bit more user friendly. Then, I changed the arrows so their intended use was clearer to the user. Next, when designing the other frames of my application, I referred to other websites for ideas. For example, I referred to Amazon's book details page and incorporated it into the
          "Where to Buy It" section of my app. Lastly, I referred to another second hand app called 'depop' and incorporated the 'Sell' page to my 'Sell Book' frame.

        <p>
          After I finished putting together my first high fidelity mockup, I performed another round of usability tests performing the same tasks, but with different participants. I also received feedback on the user interface, as well as the design of my high fidelity app. One participant stated that my dashboard icons were too dark and the contrast seemed a little off. Another participant stated that the 'More' tab had a lot of subtabs and that it looked a little overwhelming to the eye. Lastly, the same participant also stated that my book images and icons were a little too small to tap on a mobile device and to possibly consider making them a little bigger.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my final iterations, I made changes based on the feedback that the participants made during my second usability test. Some additional changes that were made in my final protoype include making the application more modern, and removing any visual noise (like outlines). I also improved the landing page and added a new image, as well as making my dashboard a little more interactive to the user.

        <p>
          In conclusion, I learned quite a bit from this project. If I were to start again from the beginning, I would add a few more questions on my user survey about the sustainability aspect of my app. For example, I would ask what users thought about having the option of providing their own shipping boxes when selling a book, if collaborating with an eco-friendly shipping company would be a good fit, if providing post-consumer packaging would be beneficial, or if all three of these options together would be most desirable. I would also do more research on different eco-friendly shipping companies and shipping costs.
